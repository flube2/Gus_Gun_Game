The world has wronged Gus in so many ways, we cannot possibly begin to comprehend.
He can't move his arms and a dunce cap was placed on his head when he was 6 due to a situation he wasn't even involved in.
To help Gus get back at the world, and all those who laughed at him, he must first train.
Help him by shooting or running through the yellow cubes and white spheres to earn points.
The red cubes and white poles don't move and are indestructible, but the top of the pole is a fun place to hang out and shoot things!
If the training course accumulates too many rounds of ammunition and they start getting in your way, 
just push them under the walls and let them fall into the endless void. 
Someday, Gus's quest may continue, but for now, this is it.

On Windows, download the zip file, extract it, double click the Gus_Gun_Game.exe file, and enjoy!
